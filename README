This is a set of bindings to FluidSynth, providing Python objects that wrap
the standard FluidSynth API and provide object functions as methods.

You will need Cython to build the extension.

A few demos are included.

TODO:

- The rest of the API should be wrapped. There are missing methods on a few
  of the classes, and a few objects, like FluidSequencer, are missing.
- The API should be documented.

If you find this package useful, please let me know. If you find it
inadequate for your needs or wants, please feel free to submit patches or
requests for features.
